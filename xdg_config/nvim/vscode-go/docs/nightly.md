# Go Nightly

This master branch of this extension is built and published nightly through the [Go Nightly]. If you're interested in testing new features and bug fixes, you may be interested in switching to the [Go Nightly] extension. Also, if you file an issue, we may suggest trying out the fix in [Go Nightly].

[Go Nightly] is the **preview** version of the Go extension, so it may be broken or unstable at times.

## Installation

To use the [Go Nightly] extension (`golang.go-nightly`), you **must** first disable the standard Go extension (`golang.go`). The two are not compatible and will cause conflicts if enabled simultaneously.

If you'd like to make a permanent switch, you can uninstall the Go extension.

Otherwise, you can disable it temporarily. To do so, open the Extensions view in VS Code, click on the gear icon next to the Go extension, and select Disable. Read more in the [documentation on how to disable an extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_disable-an-extension).

Once you have uninstalled or disabled the standard Go extension, search for [Go Nightly] in the VS Code Marketplace and install it instead.

### Community

Go Nightly users are encouraged to discuss issues and share feedback in the [#vscode-go-nightly](https://gophers.slack.com/archives/C01DQ2KBMNU) channel on [Gophers Slack] or on the [Go Nightly mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/vscode-go-nightly). The VS Code Go maintainers may send communications to these channels to request feedback as well.

## Releases

A new version of [Go Nightly], based on the repository's current [`master` branch](https://go.googlesource.com/vscode-go/+/refs/heads/master), will be released at least once a day between Monday and Thursday. If there are no new commits at master, a new version **will not** be released.

The version number encodes the last commit timestamp of the master branch, with the format `YYYY.[M]M.[D]DHH`. For example, version `2020.3.702` indicates that the extension was built with a final commit merged at ~2AM 2020/03/07 (UTC).

## Testing pre-releases

Pre-releases of the Go extension will be made available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/releases) on GitHub. These will be separate from the Go Nightly extension. If you would like to try a pre-release, follow these instructions:

1) Download the `.vsix` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/releases).
2) Navigate to the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X). Click on the "..." in the top-right corner, select "Install from VSIX", and select the `.vsix` file you downloaded. Alternatively, you can run `code --install-extension Go-latest.vsix` or open the Command Palette and run the "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." command.
3) If prompted, reload VS Code.

**Note**: If you install an extension from a VSIX file, you will stop receiving automatic prompts when updates are released.
